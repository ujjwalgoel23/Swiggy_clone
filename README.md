⚠️ Important Notice Before Using
Swiggy’s APIs come with CORS limitations, so the app cannot fetch data directly from the browser without a proxy. To access real-time API data, this project utilizes a CORS proxy.

Before using the app, visit this link:
https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/
Click "Request temporary access to the demo server."

Skipping this step may result in no data loading due to blocked API requests.
